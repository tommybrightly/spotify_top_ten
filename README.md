# üéß Spotify Top 10

A modern Angular app that authenticates users via Spotify and displays their top 10 most played tracks, complete with album art and preview buttons.

> Built to showcase full-stack knowledge, API integration, authentication flow with PKCE, and responsive Tailwind styling. 

‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: Due to Spotify's production requirements which don't allow small developers to have public facing apps using their API, this app is intended to be run locally using your own Spotify Developer credentials. See setup instructions below.
